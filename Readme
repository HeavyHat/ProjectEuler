Project Euler Implementation

Each program is contained within its own class ex<excercise number>.java, with the following structure:

public ex? extends ProjectEulerSolution
{
  public ex?()
  {
    decription = "<Decription>";
  }

  public void run(String[] args)
  {
    //implementation
  }
}

Every excercise should therefore be launched through the ProjEuler class in the following fashion:

ProjEuler <Excercise Number> <CMD Arguments>

This will then provide the time taken for each excercise as well as a description.
